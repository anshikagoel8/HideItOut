# HideItOut
Steganography software can be used to hide a text data inside a image or an audio, to protect the privacy of the data

The purpose of the project is to encrypt the data i.e., hide the text data over an image or audio using least significant bit (LSB) steganographic algorithm in order
to provide informational security so that no unauthorized user or hacker could access the data.

“Steganography‟ and “Cryptography‟ are closely related constructs. The hidden or embedded image, audio or a video files act as carriers to send the private messages
to the destination without any security breach. Steganography techniques can be implemented on various file formats such as audio (“mp3‟, “wmv.‟, etc.), video
(“mpeg‟, “dat‟, etc.) and images (“jpeg‟, “bmp‟, etc.). However, the images are the most preferred file format for this technique. Steganography is meant to make
the message invisible, while cryptography changes the message’s form, by means of replacement and/or algorithm.
